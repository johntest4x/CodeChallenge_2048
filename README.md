# CodeChallenge_2048
NEW - Application US based company - code challenge (HackerRank - 'Difficult')



     Design:  
     This solution implements a single forward (right to left) row transpostion solution.    
     The merging strategy for each merge situation (as per instructions) is then applied only once to this forward direction row.    
     
           
           
     Then transforms for reversal is applied (to cater for right to left  
     Then transform horizontal to vertical applied to the (prototype left to right - its 1st inversion Left to right) resulting in UP OR Down.
     
     Once a solution is created from the transform, it is orientated back to original alignment.
     
     The amount of code has been optimised, the transformations hardcoded to 4 x 4 (grid layout) but can be adapted easily.
